# NST-Classifier

## Description
This is my personal project on exploring how text data is used to do analysis 
before creating a small data product (classifier).

## Objective
The end of this project is to explore the news data and try to create a topic 
classifier (Exclusive, Crime-courts, Nation, Government-public-policy, Politics) 
based on the news obtained from NST website.

## Part I Web Scrapping (Completed)
I need to scrape some web data from the news portal. My thought is finding 
local english news website so that is easily understand by me. I found out that NST 
website can be used for this purpose. However, the news are dynamic loaded with 
JavaScript. Therefore, I need to use a screen scrapper to scrape the data and store 
in a structure format.

## Python External Library used in this project
